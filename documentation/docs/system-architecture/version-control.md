# Version Control

For version control our team will utilize Git with our main repository hosted on GitHub. Our team follows a feature-branching workflow, where new features or fixes are developed in separate branches off the main branch. This allows for focused development and easier code reviews.

All commit messages will follow a conventional commit standard which allow for clear and concise changes for other members to track.

Pull requests are mandatory for merging any changes into main. Each PR must be reviewed by at least one other team member to ensure code quality and adherence to project standards. After a successful review, PRs are merged, and the feature branch is deleted to keep the repository clean.
