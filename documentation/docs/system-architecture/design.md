# Design

<h2>Purpose</h2>

This document outlines the architecture for our web application, designed to convert natural language queries into SQL statements. Leveraging technologies like Node.js for the backend, Python for interfacing with OpenAI's ChatGPT, and other tools such as AWS Lambda and Carto's SQL API, our goal is to democratize access to database querying. This project aims to bridge the gap between complex data manipulation and user-friendly interactions, enabling users to engage with databases through conversational inputs. By detailing the system's structure and workflow, this document serves as a roadmap for the development team, ensuring clarity and coherence in our approach to creating a seamless, intuitive data querying experience.

<h2>Components and Interfaces</h2>

![alt text](PhillyGPT_BlockDiagram.png) 
Current System Architecure Diagram (work in progress)
- **Client-Side Web Application (Frontend)**
  - For PhillyGPT we will utilize a multitude of different components that will enhance our services providing a seamless experience for users. To create pages we will utilize HTML along with CSS Tailwind for styling. JavaScript will also be used to create dynamic interactions.
  The user interace will allow users to input natural language queries (prompts) which will then return a display of results based on the specific request. The frontend will communicate with the backend via HTTP requests.
- **Application Server (Backend)**
  - PhillyGPT's backend component will consist of a Node.js server which will allow us to execute our Javascript code. A Node.js server will allow PhillyGPT to have an interface that utilizes RESTful API endpoints that accept requests from the frontend, processes them (e.g., converting
    natural language to SQL queries using OpenAI API), and send responses back. This function will also interface with AWS Lambda for executing specific baackend functions and Carto's SQL API for geographical data processing.
- **OpenAI API Integration for SQL Query Generation**
  -  Philly GPT's OpenAI integration will utilize Python in order to send requests to and from OpenAI. This will allow function calls to the OpenAI API with user input and will receive SQL queries as responses. This component acts as a bridge between natural language inputs and database queries.
- **AWS Lambda Functions**
  - In order to improve performance PhillyGPT will utilize serverless functions deployed on AWS Lambda. For our purpose, triggers will activate Lambda functions which can include HTTP requests from the Node.js server. Lambda functions will be able to process data, interact with SQL database, or call external API's and return results.
- **SQL Database**
  - PhillyGPT's SQL database will consist of a database schema and tables. This will allow SQL commands for querying and manipulating data. This database will be accessed by the backend server or AWS Lambda functions to retrieve data based on SQL queries.
- **Carto's SQL API Integration**
  - For geographical purposes PhillyGPT will utilize code that makes HTTP requests to Carto's SQL API for executing SQL queries on spatial data. API requests to Carto's SQL API endpoint will be made by passing SQL queries and receiving query results in JSON format.

<h2>Sequence Diagrams for Use Cases</h2>

<h3>Use Case 1 - Number of Related Deaths</h3>

A healthcare researcher wants to study affects of covid cases.
<ol>
<li>User loads the PhillyGPT website.</li>
<li>User enters a prompt to ask the number of covid deaths.</li>
<li>User submits the prompt.</li>
<li>Based on the users response they get results related to the covid deaths query.</li>
<li>A table is displayed showing the statistics of covid related deaths within Philadelphia.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Use Case 2 - Heat Map of Crime</h3>

A user wants to find view a heat map of violent crime within North Philadelphia and do further research based on the result
<ol>
<li>User loads the PhillyGPT website</li>
<li>User enters a prompt to ask for a heat map of violent crimes in North Philadelphia</li>
<li>User submits the prompt </li>
<li>The website displays a map showing a heat map of violent crimes committed in North Philadelphia</li>
<li>The user decides to refine the prompt for the heat map to only show violent crime within North Philadelphia only in 2022</li>
<li>The website displays a heat map showing the number of violent crimes committed in North Philadelphia in 2022</li>
</ol>

<h3>Use Case 3 - Finding a Farmers Market</h3>

A new Philadelphia resident wants to find out informaiton about farmers markets in the city.
<ol>
<li>The user goes to the PhillyGPT website and inputs a prompt asking for information about the farmers markets.</li>
<li>PhillyGPT provides the user with the names and locations about various Philadelphia farmer markets. </li>
<li>The user then asks PhillyGPT about the time and date about a specific farmers market location.</li>
<li>PhillyGPT provides the user with the date and time about the specific farmers market they want to visit.</li>  
</ol>

<h3>Use Case 4 - Location Analysis</h3>

An urban planner wants to create a new green space in the city
<ol>
<li>They go to the PhillyGPT website and request analysis of the parks and green spaces around the city.</li>
<li>A map is shown of all the green spaces highlighted throughout the city.</li>
<li>A table is shown that has relevant details about every green space such as their area and amenities.</li>
</ol>
